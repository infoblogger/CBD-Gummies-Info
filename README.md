<p><a href="https://justcbdstore.uk/product-category/cbd-gummies/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/vape-pen-and-medical-marijuana-hemp-bud-cbd-and-thc-oil-vaping-picture-id1180278228?k=20&amp;m=1180278228&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=6lYISytEMNzbpnxizwkmDs_QsrX-oeqsHtKgBAL-9_A=" alt="" width="612" height="408" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD is one of the two most prominent compounds naturally found in the cannabis plant. Unlike THC, CBD isn&rsquo;t psychoactive, which means it won&rsquo;t alter the consumer&rsquo;s mind. Instead, CBD produces effects by interacting with the cannabinoid receptors &mdash; CB1, which coordinates mood, pain, movement, and CB2, affecting pain and inflammation. So when using CBD, you&rsquo;ll be essentially promoting your wellbeing, and you&rsquo;ll be dealing with specific conditions more effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the 2018 Farm Bill made industrial hemp (and hemp-derived CBD) legal for production, numerous brands have presented various CBD products. In this fast-paced market, oils and tinctures reign.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Potential Benefits of CBD Oil</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD has a spectrum of benefits for one&rsquo;s health and general wellbeing. Below, read when and why you should give CBD oil a try.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sleeplessness and Anxiety</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common use of CBD oil is to treat anxiety and related issues like insomnia and PTSD. CBD acts on the brain receptors for serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood. Essentially, CBD is a natural alternative to anti-depressants.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Pain</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD is an effective supplement to manage and treat pain. The endocannabinoids, neurotransmitters that support the regulation of pain response, immune system, sleep, and appetite, bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body, helping reduce inflammation. Anecdotal evidence points out that CBD can efficiently manage joint pain, backache, and arthritis.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Blood Pressure and Heart Conditions</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD can be a natural and effective treatment to keep your blood pressure in check. Additionally, it contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help support heart health and prevent heart-related diseases.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Dose CBD Oil</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When taking CBD for the first time, start small unless otherwise recommended by a doctor. A small dose is one of 10-20 mg a day. You should take CBD in this dose for at least a week to ensure your body tolerates it well and you don&rsquo;t have any unwanted effects. Then, you can start increasing the dose incrementally by adding 5 mg per week until you reach the desired results.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not advisable to take more than 600 mg per day.</p>
